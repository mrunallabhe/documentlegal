Statement:

On November 15, 2024, at approximately 8:12 PM, I was walking near the ABC Supermarket on MG Road when I witnessed an incident.

I saw a person wearing a black shirt enter the shop. The individual appeared to be in a hurry. I heard loud shouting and argument sounds coming from inside the shop around 8:15 PM.

At approximately 8:30 PM, I saw the same person exit the shop quickly. The person was now wearing a white shirt, which seemed unusual.

I noticed that the person had a minor injury on their left hand - it appeared to be a small cut or scratch.

I immediately called the police at 8:35 PM and reported what I had seen. The police arrived at the scene around 9:00 PM.

I am willing to testify in court if required.
