## How to Use These Files

### Option 1: Convert to PDF (Recommended)

**Using Online Converter:**
1. Go to https://www.ilovepdf.com/txt-to-pdf or similar
2. Upload the `.txt` files
3. Convert to PDF
4. Use the PDFs in the system

**Using Python:**
```bash
pip install reportlab
python convert_to_pdf.py
```

### Option 2: Use as Text Files

The system accepts `.txt` files directly. Just upload them as-is.

### Option 3: Create Test Images

For testing image features:

1. **CCTV-like Image:**
   - Create an image with text overlay: "2024-11-15 20:12:34"
   - Add location text: "ABC Supermarket - MG Road"
   - Save as `cctv_test.jpg`

2. **Crime Scene Photo:**
   - Any image with EXIF data
   - System will extract timestamp and GPS if available

   - Upload `sample_medical_report.txt`
   - Upload `sample_fir.txt`
   - Upload `sample_police_memo.txt`

2. **Process Each File:**
   - Use the same case_id for all files (or different ones to test separately)

3. **Get Report:**
   - View extracted text from each document
   - See entities extracted
   - Check timeline construction
   - Review inconsistencies detected
   - See missing evidence suggestions

## Creating PDFs from Text Files

I've included a Python script to convert these to PDFs. Run:

```bash
cd test_data
python create_test_pdfs.py
```

This will create PDF versions of all text files.
